# Best-Selling-Books-App

A terminal application for looking up the best selling books on Barnes & Noble using Puppeteer with Node.js.

## Background

I wanted to find a way to scrape the best selling books and see the relevant information on these books with the ability to go to their webpage to buy the book.

Initially, I created a Ruby script using the Nokogiri gem for this process. While it was able to scrape some information (URL, Title, Author, and Price), I encountered issues trying to scrape the rating of the book and the reviews from an individual books page.

This cause me to recreate this app using Puppeteer for JavaScript where I was able to successfully scrape more information on each book. 

## Installation

The three libraries used are Puppeteer, Prompt-sync and Open.

```bash
npm install puppeteer
npm install prompt-sync
npm install open
```

If interested in the Ruby version, the gems used are Nokogiri, HTTParty, TTY-Table, Launchy, and TTY-Prompt.

```bash
gem install nokogiri
gem install httparty
gem install tty-table
gem install launchy
gem install tty-prompt
```
